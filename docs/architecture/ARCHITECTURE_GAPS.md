# Architecture Gaps - Design Issues Analysis

**Status:** OPEN ISSUES - Requires Decisions  
**Created:** 2025-11-02  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-03  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Must Resolve Before Implementation (Week 1)

---

## Purpose

This document identifies **architectural design flaws and inconsistencies** in the S1mpleTraderV3 design. These are NOT implementation gaps (missing code), but conceptual issues in the architecture itself that must be resolved before implementation begins.

**Document Evolution:**
This document contains both the **original gap analysis** (initial problem identification) and the **revised analysis** based on architectural discussions. The original analysis is preserved to maintain context and reasoning history.

**How to use this document:**
1. Review original gap analysis to understand initial problem identification
2. Read revised analysis to see how understanding evolved through discussion
3. Review final design decisions
4. Update relevant architecture docs with decisions
5. Archive this document when all gaps are resolved

### GAP-001: StrategyCache Singleton vs Multi-Strategy Execution (ORIGINAL)

**Location:** `POINT_IN_TIME_MODEL.md`, `PLATFORM_COMPONENTS.md`

**Problem:**
StrategyCache was conceptualized as a singleton with reconfigure() method, creating race conditions in concurrent multi-strategy execution.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The conflict arose from three architectural insights:

1. **EventBus Scope Filtering:** Platform-scoped events (e.g., market tick) can trigger MULTIPLE strategies simultaneously via scope filtering
2. **Point-in-Time Model:** Cache must be stateless - fresh dict per tick, cleared after run completion
3. **Bus-Agnostic Architecture:** ALL components (including FlowInitiator) are bus-agnostic and communicate via EventAdapters

**Key Realization:**
FlowInitiator (tick flow coordinator) CANNOT be singleton because:
- One RAW_TICK event (ScopeLevel.PLATFORM) triggers multiple strategies
- Each strategy needs isolated FlowInitiator + StrategyCache pair
- EventBus scope filtering (SubscriptionScope.should_receive_event) enables multi-strategy triggering

**DECISION: Per-Strategy Instances**

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ Perfect isolation - Each strategy has dedicated cache + FlowInitiator
2. ✅ Simpler API - Workers don't need strategy_id parameter
3. ✅ Clear lifecycle - Cache created per strategy, injected via DI
4. ✅ Bus-agnostic consistency - FlowInitiator treated like any Worker (EventAdapter pattern)
5. ✅ Platte orkestratie - No StrategyFactory hierarchy, direct assembly in OperationService
6. ✅ YAGNI - No premature abstraction, readable top-to-bottom flow

### GAP-002: System Event Naming - UUID vs Static Wiring (ORIGINAL)

**Location:** `EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md`

**Initial Problem:**
Documentation initially suggested system events use **runtime-generated UUIDs**, creating an impossible situation where static `strategy_wiring_map.yaml` would need to contain event names that don't exist yet.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
This was a **misunderstanding** of the V3 architecture. After reviewing the Strategy Builder UI documentation and addenda, the actual design is:

**DECISION: UI-Generated Event Names at Configuration Time**

**How It Actually Works:**

**Phase 1: Strategy Building (UI Session)**

The **Strategy Builder UI** generates unique event names **during the configuration phase** (NOT runtime):

```typescript
// Strategy Builder UI (TypeScript)
function onWorkerPlaced(worker: WorkerInstance, slot: Slot, position: number) {
    // Generate unique event name DURING UI SESSION
    const eventName = `_${worker.instance_id}_OUTPUT_${generateUID()}`;
    
    // Store in strategy_wiring_map.yaml
    addWiringRule({
        source: {
            component_id: worker.instance_id,
            event_name: eventName,  // Generated NOW, not at runtime
            event_type: "SystemEvent"
        },
        target: {
            component_id: nextWorker.instance_id,
            handler_method: "process"
        }
    });
}
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Static Configuration: All event names exist in `strategy_wiring_map.yaml` before runtime
- ✅ UI Responsibility: Strategy Builder generates unique names during configuration
- ✅ No Runtime Generation: EventAdapter uses pre-configured names from BuildSpecs
- ✅ Predictable Wiring: Subscribers know exact event names at bootstrap time

**Architectural Principle:**
> "The Strategy Builder UI is the **event name authority**. It generates all system event names during strategy construction, ensuring the `strategy_wiring_map.yaml` is a complete, static specification that requires NO runtime name generation."

## 🔴 CRITICAL GAPS (Must Fix Before Week 1)

### GAP-001: StrategyCache Singleton vs Multi-Strategy Execution ✅ RESOLVED

**Location:** `POINT_IN_TIME_MODEL.md`, `PLATFORM_COMPONENTS.md`

**Problem:**
StrategyCache was conceptualized as a singleton with reconfigure() method, creating race conditions in concurrent multi-strategy execution.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The conflict arose from three architectural insights:

1. **EventBus Scope Filtering:** Platform-scoped events (e.g., market tick) can trigger MULTIPLE strategies simultaneously via scope filtering
2. **Point-in-Time Model:** Cache must be stateless - fresh dict per tick, cleared after run completion
3. **Bus-Agnostic Architecture:** ALL components (including FlowInitiator) are bus-agnostic and communicate via EventAdapters

- One RAW_TICK event (ScopeLevel.PLATFORM) triggers multiple strategies
- Each strategy needs isolated FlowInitiator + StrategyCache pair
- EventBus scope filtering (SubscriptionScope.should_receive_event) enables multi-strategy triggering

**DECISION: Per-Strategy Instances (Option B)**

**Architecture:**
```python
# backend/core/strategy_cache.py
class StrategyCache:
    """
    Per-strategy point-in-time DTO container (NOT singleton).
    
    Lifecycle: Created per strategy, injected into workers.

        """Clear after run completion (point-in-time principle)."""
        self._current_cache.clear()
        self._current_anchor = None
```

```python
# FlowInitiator: Per-strategy component (NOT singleton)
class FlowInitiator:
    """
    Per-strategy tick flow coordinator.

    def __init__(self, strategy_cache: StrategyCache):
        self._cache = strategy_cache
    
    def on_raw_tick(self, tick_data: Dict) -> DispositionEnvelope:

        self._cache.start_new_strategy_run(
            strategy_cache={},

            disposition=Disposition.PUBLISH,
            event_name="STRATEGY_RUN_STARTED",  # System event

            wiring=strategy_link.wiring
        )
        
        # 2. FLAT ORCHESTRATION (readable, no factory hierarchy)
        # Create per-strategy components
        cache = StrategyCache()  # Per-strategy instance

            strategy_id=strategy_link.id,
            workers=workers,
            wiring_spec=buildspecs.wiring,
            event_bus=self._event_bus
        )
        
        # Wire FlowInitiator via EventAdapter (bus-agnostic)
        flow_adapter = EventAdapter(
            component_id="flow_initiator",
            worker=flow_initiator,
            event_bus=self._event_bus,
            strategy_id=strategy_link.id,
            subscriptions=["RAW_TICK"],  # Platform-scoped subscription
            handler_mapping={"RAW_TICK": "on_raw_tick"},
            system_event_publications={"CONTINUE": "STRATEGY_RUN_STARTED"}
        )
        adapters["flow_initiator"] = flow_adapter
        
        # 3. Store strategy instance
        self._strategies[strategy_link.id] = StrategyInstance(
            cache=cache,
            flow_initiator=flow_initiator,
            workers=workers,
            adapters=adapters
        )
```

**Multi-Strategy Concurrent Execution Flow:**
```python
# Platform-scoped producer publishes ONCE
market_adapter.publish(
    event_name="RAW_TICK",
    payload={"symbol": "BTC_EUR", "timestamp": ...},
    scope=ScopeLevel.PLATFORM,
    strategy_instance_id=None  # Platform scope
)

# EventBus scope filtering triggers MULTIPLE FlowInitiators
# Strategy A's FlowInitiator
flow_initiator_a.on_raw_tick(payload)  # Resets cache_a

# Strategy B's FlowInitiator
flow_initiator_b.on_raw_tick(payload)  # Resets cache_b

# Both strategies run concurrently with isolated caches
```

**Rationale:**
1. ✅ **Perfect isolation** - Each strategy has dedicated cache + FlowInitiator
2. ✅ **Simpler API** - Workers don't need strategy_id parameter
3. ✅ **Clear lifecycle** - Cache created per strategy, injected via DI
4. ✅ **Bus-agnostic consistency** - FlowInitiator treated like any Worker (EventAdapter pattern)
5. ✅ **Platte orkestratie** - No StrategyFactory hierarchy, direct assembly in OperationService
6. ✅ **YAGNI** - No premature abstraction, readable top-to-bottom flow

**Architectural Implications:**
- **Factory Uniformity:** ALL event-driven components (Workers, FlowInitiator, Adapters) use EventAdapter pattern
- **No StrategyFactory:** Assembly happens directly in OperationService (flat orchestration)
- **DRY Trade-off:** Pragmatic choice - leesbaarheid > abstractie voor 10-15 regels assembly code
- **Singleton Redefinition:** Platform singletons (EventBus, PluginRegistry) vs Per-Strategy components (Cache, FlowInitiator, Workers)

**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED - Per-Strategy Instances + Flat Orchestration**

**Impact:**
- ✅ IStrategyCache protocol - no changes needed (already per-instance design)
- ✅ Worker initialization - cache injection via WorkerFactory
- ✅ OperationService - flat orchestration (no StrategyFactory)
- ⚠️ POINT_IN_TIME_MODEL.md - clarify StrategyCache is per-strategy
- ⚠️ PLATFORM_COMPONENTS.md - update singleton definition

### GAP-002: Event-Centric Connector Architecture ✅ RESOLVED

**Location:** `EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md`, `PLUGIN_ANATOMY.md`

**Problem:**
Unclear how workers remain bus-agnostic while supporting both system flow control events and custom business events. Three core questions:
1. How do workers declare their inputs/outputs without knowing EventBus?
2. How does the adapter know what payload types to expect/produce?
3. How do we validate wiring at bootstrap without runtime overhead?

**Root Cause Analysis:**
Missing **complete connector abstraction** with payload type declarations and event-centric wiring model.

**DECISION: Event-Centric Connector Architecture**

### **Architecture Principles**

1. **Workers are connector-based factories**
   - Declare abstract inputs/outputs in manifest (connectors)
   - Zero knowledge of EventBus, event names, or wiring
   - EventAdapter translates connectors ↔ events at runtime

2. **Event names are the interface**
   - Wiring rules connect events (not workers directly)
   - Adapters subscribe to event names, publish to event names
   - Workers can be replaced without touching consumers

3. **Bootstrap validation only**
   - Fail-fast during configuration load (~100ms one-time cost)
   - Zero runtime validation (thousands of events/second)
   - Trust bootstrap-validated configuration

4. **Uniform EventAdapter for ALL components**
   - Same implementation for workers, singletons, FlowInitiators
   - EventBus handles scope filtering (PLATFORM vs STRATEGY)
   - Configuration drives behavior (not adapter code)

---

### **Plugin Manifest Schema**

Workers declare abstract inputs/outputs without knowing events or wiring.

**Complete Example:**
```yaml
# plugins/signal_detectors/fvg_detector/manifest.yaml
plugin_id: "s1mple/fvg_detector/v1.0.0"
category: "signal_detector"

capabilities:
  io:
    multi_input: false      # Only default_trigger
    broadcast_output: true  # Signal used by planner + logger + risk monitor

dependencies:
  requires_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
  
  produces_dtos:
    - dto_class: "FVGAnalysisDTO"
      local_path: "dtos/fvg_analysis_dto.py"

inputs:
  - connector_id: "default_trigger"
    handler_method: "process"

outputs:
  # Flow control (no payload)
  - connector_id: "completion"
    disposition: "CONTINUE"
    payload_type: null
  
  # System DTO output (Signal, Risk, StrategyDirective, etc.)
  - connector_id: "signal_detected"
    disposition: "PUBLISH"
    payload_type: "Signal"
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"
  
  # Custom DTO output (from produces_dtos)
  - connector_id: "analysis_broadcast"
    disposition: "PUBLISH"
    payload_type: "FVGAnalysisDTO"
    payload_source: "local"  # References produces_dtos
```

**Manifest Fields:**

**capabilities.io:**
- `multi_input`: Does this worker listen to multiple events? (true/false)
  - `false`: Only default_trigger (simple chain worker)
  - `true`: Multiple event subscriptions (aggregator/reactor pattern)
- `broadcast_output`: Are outputs consumed by multiple workers? (true/false)
  - `false`: Single consumer (linear chain)
  - `true`: Multiple consumers (hub/fan-out pattern)

**Purpose:**
- UI validation: Warn if broadcast_output worker has only one consumer wired
- Documentation: Quick identification of worker patterns (hub, leaf, chain, aggregator)
- Performance hints: Broadcast workers may need EventBus priority/batching

**dependencies:**
- `requires_dtos`: TickCache DTOs this worker reads (via `get_required_dtos()`)
- `produces_dtos`: TickCache DTOs this worker writes (via `set_result_dto()`)

**inputs:**
- `connector_id`: Unique identifier for this input
- `handler_method`: Method name on worker class to invoke

**outputs:**
- `connector_id`: Unique identifier for this output
- `disposition`: `CONTINUE` (flow control) or `PUBLISH` (event broadcast)
- `payload_type`: DTO class name (null for no payload)
- `payload_source`: Import path or "local" for produces_dtos DTOs

---

### **Worker Implementation: Bus-Agnostic**

Workers know NOTHING about events, EventBus, or wiring:

```python
class FVGDetector(IWorker):
    """
    Worker knows:
    ✓ Handler method names from manifest (process)
    ✓ Connector IDs from manifest (completion, signal_detected, analysis_broadcast)
    ✓ DTO types it produces/consumes
    
    Worker does NOT know:
    ✗ Event names
    ✗ EventBus existence
    ✗ Other workers
    ✗ Wiring configuration
    """
    
    def process(self) -> DispositionEnvelope:
        # Get TickCache DTOs (dependency resolution)
        ema_data = self.strategy_cache.get_required_dtos()[EMAOutputDTO]
        
        # Perform analysis
        fvg_analysis = self._analyze_fvg(ema_data)
        
        # Store analysis DTO to TickCache
        self.strategy_cache.set_result_dto(fvg_analysis)
        
        if fvg_analysis.signal_strength > 0.8:
            # PUBLISH with System DTO payload
            # Worker does NOT know event name - EventAdapter handles routing
            return DispositionEnvelope(
                disposition=Disposition.PUBLISH,
                connector_id="signal_detected",  # From manifest
                payload=Signal(...)              # System DTO
            )
        
        # CONTINUE - proceed to next worker
        # Worker does NOT know which worker is next
        return DispositionEnvelope(
            disposition=Disposition.CONTINUE,
            connector_id="completion"  # From manifest
        )
```

**Key Points:**
- Worker returns `connector_id` (from its manifest), NOT event names
- Worker returns `payload` (DTO), NOT event-specific data
- EventAdapter translates connector_id → event_name (via wiring config)
- Worker is completely decoupled from event routing

---

### **Wiring Map Schema**

Strategy wiring maps are created in the Strategy Builder UI and define the event-based connections between workers. They are **strategy-agnostic** - containing no strategy_id references - making them reusable templates that can be coupled to different strategy instances via operation configuration.

---

#### **Strategy Wiring Map Structure**

**Origin:** Generated by Strategy Builder UI when user visually connects workers and assigns event names.

**Purpose:** Event-centric wiring configuration defining subscriptions and publications per worker.

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Strategy-agnostic (no `strategy_id` in file)
- ✅ Reusable template (same wiring for multiple strategy instances)
- ✅ Coupled at runtime via operation config (strategy blueprint + wiring map + execution environment)
- ✅ Event-based (workers connected via event names, not direct connections)

**Schema:**

```yaml
# strategy_wiring_map.yaml
# Generated by Strategy Builder UI

metadata:
  wiring_id: "momentum_scalping_v1"
  description: "Fast momentum detection with regime filtering"
  created_at: "2025-11-03T10:30:00Z"
  version: "1.0.0"

adapter_configurations:
  # FlowInitiator (per-strategy platform component)
  flow_initiator:
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: RAW_TICK  # From execution environment (platform scope)
        connector_id: tick_trigger
    publications:
      - connector_id: run_started
        event_name: STRATEGY_RUN_STARTED  # UI assigned or default

  # Strategy workers
  ema_detector_fast:
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: STRATEGY_RUN_STARTED
        connector_id: default_trigger
    publications:
      - connector_id: completion
        event_name: EMA_FAST_READY  # UI assigned

  ema_detector_slow:
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: EMA_FAST_READY  # Chained from previous worker
        connector_id: default_trigger
    publications:
      - connector_id: completion
        event_name: EMA_SLOW_READY

  regime_classifier:
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: EMA_SLOW_READY
        connector_id: default_trigger
    publications:
      - connector_id: completion
        event_name: REGIME_CLASSIFIED
      - connector_id: regime_broadcast
        event_name: REGIME_UPDATE  # Broadcast to multiple consumers

  momentum_scout:
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: REGIME_CLASSIFIED
        connector_id: default_trigger
    publications:
      - connector_id: completion
        event_name: MOMENTUM_ANALYZED
      - connector_id: signal_detected
        event_name: MOMENTUM_SIGNAL  # Business event (Signal DTO)

  entry_planner:
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: MOMENTUM_SIGNAL
        connector_id: signal_handler
      - event_name: REGIME_UPDATE  # Fan-in: multiple inputs
        connector_id: regime_context
    publications:
      - connector_id: plan_ready
        event_name: ENTRY_PLAN_READY
```

**Field Explanations:**

**adapter_configurations:**
- Key: Component instance ID (unique within wiring map)
- Value: Subscription and publication configuration

**subscriptions:**
- `event_name`: Event to listen for (assigned in UI or platform convention)
- `connector_id`: Input connector from worker manifest

**publications:**
- `connector_id`: Output connector from worker manifest
- `event_name`: Event name to publish (assigned in UI)

#### **Manifest Scope Behavior (Platform Components)**

Platform components (FlowInitiator, AggregatedLedger, Scheduler) declare their EventBus scope behavior in their manifest, not in wiring configuration.

**Strategy-Scoped Component (FlowInitiator):**

```yaml
# backend/core/flow_initiator/manifest.yaml
plugin_id: "platform/flow_initiator/v1.0.0"
category: "platform_component"

scope_behavior:
  subscription_mode: "strategy"  # STRATEGY scope subscription
  publication_scope: "strategy"  # Publishes with STRATEGY scope

capabilities:
  io:
    multi_input: false
    broadcast_output: true  # STRATEGY_RUN_STARTED used by all workers

inputs:
  - connector_id: tick_trigger
    handler_method: on_raw_tick

outputs:
  - connector_id: run_started
    disposition: CONTINUE
    payload_type: null
```

**Platform-Scoped Unrestricted (AggregatedLedger):**

```yaml
# backend/platform/aggregated_ledger/manifest.yaml
plugin_id: "platform/aggregated_ledger/v1.0.0"
category: "platform_component"

scope_behavior:
  subscription_mode: "platform_unrestricted"  # All strategies + platform
  publication_scope: "platform"                # Platform-wide events

capabilities:
  io:
    multi_input: true      # Ledger updates from all strategies
    broadcast_output: true  # Portfolio state to risk monitors, UI, etc.

inputs:
  - connector_id: ledger_update
    handler_method: on_ledger_state_changed

outputs:
  - connector_id: portfolio_state
    disposition: PUBLISH
    payload_type: PortfolioState
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.platform.portfolio_state.PortfolioState"
```

**Platform-Scoped Selective (DebugMonitor):**

```yaml
# backend/platform/debug_monitor/manifest.yaml
plugin_id: "platform/debug_monitor/v1.0.0"
category: "platform_component"

scope_behavior:
  subscription_mode: "platform_selective"  # Specific strategies only
  # target_strategy_ids configured at bootstrap via operation config
  publication_scope: "platform"

capabilities:
  io:
    multi_input: true      # Multiple event types from selected strategies
    broadcast_output: false

inputs:
  - connector_id: event_capture
    handler_method: on_any_event
```

---

#### **EventAdapter Scope Configuration**

EventAdapter reads `scope_behavior` from manifest and constructs appropriate `SubscriptionScope` at bootstrap.

**Strategy-Scoped (FlowInitiator):**

```python
# EventWiringFactory bootstrap
def _create_subscription_scope(
    manifest: PluginManifest,
    strategy_id: str  # From operation config!
) -> SubscriptionScope:
    
    if manifest.scope_behavior.subscription_mode == "strategy":
        return SubscriptionScope(
            level=ScopeLevel.STRATEGY,
            strategy_instance_id=strategy_id  # Injected from operation config
        )
```

**Platform Unrestricted (AggregatedLedger):**

```python
    if manifest.scope_behavior.subscription_mode == "platform_unrestricted":
        return SubscriptionScope(
            level=ScopeLevel.PLATFORM,
            target_strategy_ids=None  # Unrestricted - all strategies
        )
```

**Platform Selective (DebugMonitor):**

```python
    if manifest.scope_behavior.subscription_mode == "platform_selective":
        # target_strategy_ids from operation config
        return SubscriptionScope(
            level=ScopeLevel.PLATFORM,
            target_strategy_ids=operation_config.monitored_strategies
        )
```

**Publication Scope:**

```python
# When EventAdapter processes DispositionEnvelope
def _handle_disposition(self, envelope: DispositionEnvelope):
    publication = self._config.get_publication(envelope.connector_id)
    
    # Scope from manifest.scope_behavior.publication_scope
    if self._manifest.scope_behavior.publication_scope == "strategy":
        self._bus.publish(
            publication.event_name,
            payload=envelope.payload,
            scope=ScopeLevel.STRATEGY,
            strategy_instance_id=self._strategy_id  # From bootstrap
        )
    
    elif self._manifest.scope_behavior.publication_scope == "platform":
        self._bus.publish(
            publication.event_name,
            payload=envelope.payload,
            scope=ScopeLevel.PLATFORM  # No strategy_id
        )
```

#### **Scope Filtering Rules (EventBus)**

EventBus filters events based on publish scope and subscription scope:

**Platform-Scoped Events:**
- Published with `ScopeLevel.PLATFORM` (no strategy_instance_id)
- Received by: **Everyone** (all subscriptions, regardless of scope mode)
- Example: `RAW_TICK` from execution environment

**Strategy-Scoped Events:**
- Published with `ScopeLevel.STRATEGY` + `strategy_instance_id`
- Received by:
  - ✅ STRATEGY subscriptions with matching strategy_id
  - ✅ PLATFORM unrestricted subscriptions (all strategies)
  - ✅ PLATFORM selective subscriptions (if strategy_id in target set)
  - ❌ STRATEGY subscriptions with different strategy_id

**Examples:**

```python
# FlowInitiator (strategy scope) receives platform events
subscription = SubscriptionScope(
    level=ScopeLevel.STRATEGY,
    strategy_instance_id="STR_A"
)
subscription.should_receive_event(ScopeLevel.PLATFORM, None)  # ✅ True

# FlowInitiator only receives own strategy events
subscription.should_receive_event(ScopeLevel.STRATEGY, "STR_A")  # ✅ True
subscription.should_receive_event(ScopeLevel.STRATEGY, "STR_B")  # ❌ False

# AggregatedLedger (unrestricted) receives all strategy events
subscription = SubscriptionScope(
    level=ScopeLevel.PLATFORM,
    target_strategy_ids=None
)
subscription.should_receive_event(ScopeLevel.STRATEGY, "STR_A")  # ✅ True
subscription.should_receive_event(ScopeLevel.STRATEGY, "STR_B")  # ✅ True

# DebugMonitor (selective) only receives selected strategies
subscription = SubscriptionScope(
    level=ScopeLevel.PLATFORM,
    target_strategy_ids={"STR_A", "STR_B"}
)
subscription.should_receive_event(ScopeLevel.STRATEGY, "STR_A")  # ✅ True
subscription.should_receive_event(ScopeLevel.STRATEGY, "STR_C")  # ❌ False
```

---

#### **Operation Config Coupling**

Strategy wiring map is coupled to strategy blueprint and execution environment via operation configuration:

```yaml
# operation_config.yaml
strategies:
  - strategy_instance_id: "momentum_scalper_btc_1"
    blueprint_id: "momentum_scalper_v2"  # Strategy blueprint
    wiring_map_id: "momentum_scalping_v1"  # Strategy wiring map
    execution_environment: "live_binance"
    
    # Strategy-scoped platform components get this ID
    # Enables multiple instances of same strategy
    
  - strategy_instance_id: "momentum_scalper_eth_1"
    blueprint_id: "momentum_scalper_v2"  # Same blueprint
    wiring_map_id: "momentum_scalping_v1"  # Same wiring
    execution_environment: "live_binance"  # Same environment
    
    # Different instance ID = isolated event scope
```

**Result:**
- Same strategy blueprint + wiring map can run multiple isolated instances
- Each instance has unique `strategy_instance_id` for event scoping
- FlowInitiator per instance subscribes/publishes with own strategy_id
- Workers isolated via EventBus scope filtering

---

### **Bootstrap Validation: Fail-Fast**

EventWiringFactory validates configuration ONCE at bootstrap:

```python
class EventWiringFactory:
    def create_adapters(
        self,
        strategy_id: str,
        workers: Dict[str, IWorker],
        wiring_spec: WiringSpec
    ) -> Dict[str, EventAdapter]:
        
        for rule in wiring_spec.wiring_rules:
            source_worker = workers[rule.source.component_id]
            target_worker = workers[rule.target.component_id]
            
            # ✅ Validate source connector exists in manifest
            source_connector = self._get_output_connector(
                source_worker.manifest,
                rule.source.connector_id
            )
            if not source_connector:
                raise ConfigurationError(
                    f"Connector {rule.source.connector_id} not found "
                    f"in {source_worker.manifest.plugin_id}"
                )
            
            # ✅ Validate target connector exists in manifest
            target_connector = self._get_input_connector(
                target_worker.manifest,
                rule.target.connector_id
            )
            if not target_connector:
                raise ConfigurationError(
                    f"Connector {rule.target.connector_id} not found "
                    f"in {target_worker.manifest.plugin_id}"
                )
            
            # ✅ Validate handler method exists on worker
            if not hasattr(target_worker, rule.target.handler_method):
                raise ConfigurationError(
                    f"Handler {rule.target.handler_method} not found "
                    f"on {target_worker.__class__.__name__}"
                )
            
            # ✅ Validate payload type compatibility
            if source_connector.payload_type != target_connector.payload_type:
                raise ConfigurationError(
                    f"Payload type mismatch: "
                    f"{rule.source.component_id}.{source_connector.connector_id} "
                    f"produces {source_connector.payload_type}, "
                    f"{rule.target.component_id}.{target_connector.connector_id} "
                    f"expects {target_connector.payload_type}"
                )
            
            # ✅ Validate payload_source can be imported
            if source_connector.payload_source:
                try:
                    self._import_class(source_connector.payload_source)
                except ImportError as e:
                    raise ConfigurationError(
                        f"Cannot import {source_connector.payload_source}: {e}"
                    )
        
        # ✅ Validate DTO dependencies
        for component_id, worker in workers.items():
            for required_dto in worker.manifest.dependencies.requires_dtos:
                if not self._dto_available(required_dto.source):
                    raise ConfigurationError(
                        f"{component_id} requires {required_dto.dto_class} "
                        f"from {required_dto.source} but it's not available"
                    )
        
        # If we reach here: Configuration is VALID
        # Build and return adapters (trust configuration at runtime)
        return self._build_adapters(strategy_id, workers, wiring_spec)
```

**Validation Checks:**
1. Connector existence (inputs/outputs in manifest)
2. Handler method existence (on worker class)
3. Payload type compatibility (source → target match)
4. Import validation (payload_source can be imported)
5. DTO dependency completeness (requires_dtos available)

**Performance:**
- Bootstrap: ~100ms one-time cost
- Runtime: ZERO validation overhead
- Result: Fail-fast safety without performance penalty

---

### **Runtime Execution: Zero Validation**

EventAdapter trusts bootstrap-validated configuration:

```python
class EventAdapter:
    def __init__(self, component: IWorker, config: AdapterConfig):
        self._component = component
        self._config = config  # Bootstrap-validated config
    
    def handle_event(self, event: Event):
        # NO validation here - trust bootstrap!
        subscription = self._config.get_subscription(event.name)
        handler = getattr(self._component, subscription.handler_method)
        
        # Call handler with payload (type already validated)
        result = handler(event.payload)
        
        # Process disposition
        self._handle_disposition(result)
    
    def _handle_disposition(self, envelope: DispositionEnvelope):
        if envelope.disposition == Disposition.CONTINUE:
            # Publish system event (no payload)
            publication = self._config.get_publication_for_connector(envelope.connector_id)
            self._bus.publish(
                publication.event_name,
                publication.scope,
                payload=None
            )
        
        elif envelope.disposition == Disposition.PUBLISH:
            # Publish event WITH payload (System DTO or Custom DTO)
            publication = self._config.get_publication_for_connector(envelope.connector_id)
            self._bus.publish(
                publication.event_name,
                publication.scope,
                payload=envelope.payload  # DTO travels in event
            )
```

---

### **System DTOs vs TickCache DTOs**

Two separate transport mechanisms with different purposes:

#### **System DTOs (via EventBus)**

**Purpose:** Flow control signals (Signal, Risk, StrategyDirective, EntryPlan, etc.)

**Transport:** DispositionEnvelope.payload → EventBus

```python
# Worker publishes Signal via PUBLISH disposition
return DispositionEnvelope(
    disposition=Disposition.PUBLISH,
    connector_id="signal_detected",  # From manifest
    payload=Signal(...)              # ← Travels in event payload
)

# EventAdapter translates connector_id → event_name (from wiring config)
# Then publishes to EventBus
self._bus.publish(
    event_name="SIGNAL_XYZ",  # From wiring config, NOT from worker
    scope=ScopeLevel.STRATEGY,
    payload=envelope.payload  # ← Signal in event
)

# Consumer receives via handler
def on_signal(self, signal: Signal):
    # Signal came directly from event payload
    self.plan_entry(signal)
```

**Manifest:**
```yaml
outputs:
  - connector_id: "signal_detected"
    disposition: "PUBLISH"
    payload_type: "Signal"
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"
```

#### **TickCache DTOs (via StrategyCache)**

**Purpose:** Worker calculation results (EMAOutputDTO, MarketStructureDTO, etc.)

**Transport:** StrategyCache.set_result_dto() / get_required_dtos()

```python
# Worker stores calculation result to TickCache
result = EMAOutputDTO(fast=50.2, slow=51.1, ...)
self.strategy_cache.set_result_dto(result)

# Return CONTINUE (no event payload)
return DispositionEnvelope(disposition=Disposition.CONTINUE)

# Consumer retrieves from TickCache
def process(self):
    ema_data = self.strategy_cache.get_required_dtos()[EMAOutputDTO]
    # Use ema_data in calculation
```

**Manifest:**
```yaml
dependencies:
  produces_dtos:
    - dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
      local_path: "dtos/ema_output_dto.py"
  
  requires_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
```

**Key Difference:**
- **System DTOs:** Event-driven flow (Signal triggers Planning)
- **TickCache DTOs:** Dependency resolution (EMA data available for consumers)

---

### **Uniform EventAdapter Pattern**

ALL components use the same EventAdapter implementation:

**Components:**
- Strategy workers (SignalDetectors, ContextWorkers, etc.)
- Platform singletons (PositionManager, OrderRouter, etc.)
- FlowInitiators (per-strategy tick entry points)

**NO platform vs strategy adapter types:**

```python
# ✅ ONE EventAdapter implementation for ALL
class EventAdapter:
    def __init__(
        self,
        component: IWorker,
        bus: EventBus,
        config: AdapterConfig
    ):
        self._component = component
        self._bus = bus
        self._config = config  # Contains scope info
    
    def _publish(self, event_name: str, scope: ScopeLevel, payload: Any):
        # Scope from config (not hardcoded in adapter)
        self._bus.publish(event_name, scope, payload)
```

**Scope filtering in EventBus:**

```python
class EventBus:
    def publish(
        self,
        event_name: str,
        scope: ScopeLevel,
        payload: Any,
        strategy_id: str = None
    ):
        if scope == ScopeLevel.PLATFORM:
            # Broadcast to ALL strategies + platform subscribers
            self._publish_to_all_scopes(event_name, payload)
        elif scope == ScopeLevel.STRATEGY:
            # Publish only to specific strategy scope
            self._publish_to_strategy(event_name, payload, strategy_id)
```

**Result:**
- EventAdapter code is IDENTICAL for all components
- Scope filtering happens in EventBus (not adapter)
- Configuration determines behavior

---

**Decision:** ✅ **APPROVED - Event-Centric Connector Architecture**

**Impact:**
- ⚠️ PLUGIN_ANATOMY.md - Update manifest schema (inputs/outputs with connector_id, NO event_name)
- ⚠️ DispositionEnvelope - Change event_name field to connector_id
- ⚠️ EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md - Document event-centric wiring
- ⚠️ ConfigTranslator - Parse wiring_rules
- ⚠️ EventWiringFactory - Implement bootstrap validation
- ⚠️ EventAdapter - Uniform implementation (no platform vs strategy types)
- ⚠️ EventBus - Scope filtering (PLATFORM/STRATEGY)
- ✅ Workers - Remain 100% bus-agnostic (no changes needed)

---

### GAP-003: PUBLISH Disposition - Payload Location Ambiguity

**Scenario:** EMADetector → MomentumScout → StrategyPlanner

#### **1. Manifests**

```yaml
# ema_detector manifest
outputs:
  - connector_id: "completion"
    disposition: "CONTINUE"
    payload_type: null

dependencies:
  produces_dtos:
    - dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
```

```yaml
# momentum_scout manifest
inputs:
  - connector_id: "default_trigger"
    handler_method: "process"
    payload_type: null

outputs:
  - connector_id: "signal_detected"
    disposition: "PUBLISH"
    event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
    payload_type: "Signal"
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"

dependencies:
  requires_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
```

```yaml
# strategy_planner manifest
inputs:
  - connector_id: "signal_input"
    handler_method: "on_signal"
    payload_type: "Signal"
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"
```

#### **2. Wiring Map**

```yaml
wiring_rules:
  - wiring_id: "ema_to_momentum"
    source:
      component_id: "ema_detector_instance_1"
      connector_id: "completion"
      event_name: "_EMA_READY"
      event_type: "SystemEvent"
    target:
      component_id: "momentum_scout_instance_1"
      connector_id: "default_trigger"
      handler_method: "process"
  
  - wiring_id: "momentum_to_planner"
    source:
      component_id: "momentum_scout_instance_1"
      connector_id: "signal_detected"
      event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
      event_type: "CustomEvent"
    target:
      component_id: "strategy_planner_instance_1"
      connector_id: "signal_input"
      handler_method: "on_signal"
```

#### **3. Bootstrap Validation**

```python
# EventWiringFactory validates:
# ✅ "completion" connector exists in ema_detector manifest
# ✅ "default_trigger" connector exists in momentum_scout manifest
# ✅ "process" method exists on MomentumScout class
# ✅ "signal_detected" connector exists in momentum_scout manifest
# ✅ "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL" payload types match (Signal → Signal)
# ✅ "on_signal" method exists on StrategyPlanner class
# ✅ EMAOutputDTO dependency available
# ✅ Signal import path valid

# Result: Configuration is VALID
```

#### **4. Runtime Execution**

```python
# Step 1: EMADetector processes
ema_detector.process()
# → Calculates EMA
# → Stores EMAOutputDTO to TickCache
# → Returns DispositionEnvelope(CONTINUE)
# → EventAdapter publishes "_EMA_READY" event (no payload)

# Step 2: EventBus routes "_EMA_READY"
momentum_scout_adapter.handle_event(Event("_EMA_READY", None))
# → Calls momentum_scout.process()

# Step 3: MomentumScout processes
momentum_scout.process()
# → Retrieves EMAOutputDTO from TickCache
# → Detects momentum
# → Returns DispositionEnvelope(PUBLISH, "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL", Signal(...))
# → EventAdapter publishes event WITH Signal payload

# Step 4: EventBus routes "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
strategy_planner_adapter.handle_event(Event("MOMENTUM_SIGNAL", Signal(...)))
# → Calls strategy_planner.on_signal(Signal(...))

# Step 5: StrategyPlanner processes
strategy_planner.on_signal(signal)
# → Receives Signal from event payload
# → Creates EntryPlan
# → Returns DispositionEnvelope(PUBLISH, "ENTRY_PLAN_READY", EntryPlan(...))
```

### GAP-003: PUBLISH Disposition - Payload Location Ambiguity

**Location:** `EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md`, `WORKER_TAXONOMY.md`

**Problem:**
Documentation contradicts itself on where PUBLISH payload goes:

**EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md says (V2 pattern):**
```yaml
# plugins/context_workers/ema_detector/manifest.yaml
plugin_id: "s1mple/ema_detector/v1.0.0"
category: "context_worker"

inputs:
  - connector_id: "default_trigger"  # Standard input
    type: "system"
    description: "Default processing trigger from previous worker or flow start"
    required: true

outputs:
  - connector_id: "completion"  # Standard CONTINUE output
    type: "system"
    description: "Signals completion for next worker in chain"
```

**UI Generation:**
```typescript
// Strategy Builder UI
class WiringManager {
    generateSystemEventName(worker: WorkerNode, connector: Connector): string {
        // Deterministic generation (NO UUID needed!)
        const generated = `_${worker.instanceId}_${connector.id}`;
        // Example: "_ema_detector_instance_1_completion"
        
        // User can rename in UI:
        return this.getUserOverride(generated) ?? generated;
        // Example: User renames to "_EMA_READY" for clarity
    }
}
```

**Generated Wiring:**
```yaml
# strategy_wiring_map.yaml
wiring_rules:
  - wiring_id: "ema_fast_to_ema_slow"
    source:
      component_id: "ema_detector_instance_1"
      connector_id: "completion"
      event_name: "_ema_detector_instance_1_completion"  # UI generated
      # OR: "_EMA_READY" (user renamed in UI)
      event_type: "SystemEvent"
    target:
      component_id: "ema_detector_instance_2"
      connector_id: "default_trigger"
      handler_method: "process"  # Default handler for system connectors
```

---

#### **2. Custom Event Connectors (Business Logic)**

**Purpose:** Domain-specific events (signals, alerts, custom triggers)

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Event names **declared in manifest** (part of plugin contract)
- ✅ User **CANNOT rename** (breaking contract would break consumers)
- ✅ Maps to `Disposition.PUBLISH` in worker code
- ✅ Handler methods declared in manifest

**Manifest Declaration:**
```yaml
# plugins/signal_detectors/momentum_scout/manifest.yaml
plugin_id: "s1mple/momentum_scout/v1.0.0"
category: "signal_detector"

inputs:
  - connector_id: "default_trigger"  # Standard system input
    type: "system"
    required: true
  
  - connector_id: "context_ready"  # CUSTOM event input
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_READY"  # DECLARED (not generated!)
    handler_method: "on_context_ready"  # Custom handler
    required: false
    description: "Optional trigger when context aggregation completes"

outputs:
  - connector_id: "completion"  # Standard system output
    type: "system"
  
  - connector_id: "opportunity_detected"  # CUSTOM event output
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY"  # DECLARED (not generated!)
    payload_type: "Signal"
    description: "Published when momentum conditions are met"
```

**UI Wiring:**
```typescript
// Strategy Builder UI
class WiringManager {
    wireCustomEvent(source: CustomConnector, target: CustomConnector): void {
        // Custom events: Use MANIFEST-DECLARED names (NOT generated!)
        addWiringRule({
            source: {
                component_id: source.workerId,
                connector_id: source.id,
                event_name: source.eventName,  // "MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY" from manifest
                event_type: "CustomEvent"
            },
            target: {
                component_id: target.workerId,
                connector_id: target.id,
                handler_method: target.handlerMethod  // "on_opportunity" from manifest
            }
        });
    }
}
```

**Generated Wiring:**
```yaml
# strategy_wiring_map.yaml
wiring_rules:
  - wiring_id: "momentum_to_planner"
    source:
      component_id: "momentum_scout_instance_1"
      connector_id: "opportunity_detected"
      event_name: "MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY"  # From manifest (immutable!)
      event_type: "CustomEvent"
    target:
      component_id: "momentum_planner_instance_1"
      connector_id: "opportunity_handler"
      handler_method: "on_opportunity"  # From manifest
```

---

#### **3. Data Connectors (DTO Output)**

**Purpose:** Make DTO production explicit in manifest (for documentation/UI)

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Not wired via EventBus (uses TickCache instead)
- ✅ Declared for **explicitness** and **UI visualization**
- ✅ Enables UI to show data flow alongside event flow

**Manifest Declaration:**
```yaml
# plugins/context_workers/ema_detector/manifest.yaml
outputs:
  - connector_id: "completion"
    type: "system"
  
  - connector_id: "ema_data"  # Data connector (TickCache)
    type: "data"
    dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
    description: "EMA calculation result available in TickCache"
```

**NOT in wiring_map.yaml** (DTO dependencies handled via manifest `requires_dtos`):
```yaml
# Consumer manifest references DTO (not event!)
dependencies:
  requires_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
```

---

### **Worker Implementation (Bus-Agnostic)**

Workers remain **completely event-agnostic**:

```python
# plugins/signal_detectors/momentum_scout/worker.py
class MomentumScout(IWorker):
    """Event-aware worker - knows custom events, NOT EventBus."""
    
    def __init__(self, manifest: PluginManifest, params: MomentumParams):
        self._manifest = manifest
        self._params = params
    
    def process(self) -> DispositionEnvelope:
        """
        Standard handler (triggered via default_trigger connector).
        
        Worker is UNAWARE of:

### **Connector Abstraction Benefits**

#### **1. Explicitness**
All workers declare inputs/outputs in manifest → Self-documenting architecture

#### **2. UI Visualization**
Strategy Builder can render workers as boxes with connector sockets:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  EMA Detector       │
│                     │
│ IN:  [trigger]      │  ← System connector
│ OUT: [completion]   │  ← System connector
│ OUT: [ema_data]     │  ← Data connector
└─────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────┐
│  Momentum Scout     │
│                     │
│ IN:  [trigger]      │  ← System connector
│ IN:  [context_rdy]  │  ← Custom event connector
│ OUT: [completion]   │  ← System connector
│ OUT: [opportunity]  │  ← Custom event connector
└─────────────────────┘
```

#### **3. Validation**
UI can validate connections:
- ✅ System → System (compatible)
- ✅ CustomEvent → CustomEvent (if event names match)
- ❌ System → CustomEvent (incompatible)
- ❌ Data → Event (incompatible)

#### **4. Flexibility**
- System event names: User can rename for readability
- Custom event names: Fixed by manifest (contract stability)
- Workers remain 100% event-agnostic

---

### **Complete Flow Example**

#### **Manifest (Momentum Scout)**
```yaml
plugin_id: "s1mple/momentum_scout/v1.0.0"

inputs:
  - connector_id: "default_trigger"
    type: "system"
    required: true
  
  - connector_id: "context_ready"
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_READY"
    handler_method: "on_context_ready"
    required: false

outputs:
  - connector_id: "completion"
    type: "system"
  
  - connector_id: "opportunity"
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY"
    payload_type: "Signal"
```

#### **UI Wiring**
User drags connections in Strategy Builder:
1. `EMA_Detector.completion` → `MomentumScout.default_trigger` (system)
2. `ContextAggregator.context_ready` → `MomentumScout.context_ready` (custom event)
3. `MomentumScout.opportunity` → `StrategyPlanner.signal_input` (custom event)

#### **Generated strategy_wiring_map.yaml**
```yaml
wiring_rules:
  # System event (UI generated name)
  - wiring_id: "ema_to_momentum"
    source:
      component_id: "ema_detector_instance_1"
      connector_id: "completion"
      event_name: "_ema_detector_instance_1_completion"  # UI generated
      event_type: "SystemEvent"
    target:
      component_id: "momentum_scout_instance_1"
      connector_id: "default_trigger"
      handler_method: "process"
  
  # Custom event (manifest declared name)
  - wiring_id: "context_to_momentum"
    source:
      component_id: "context_aggregator_instance_1"
      connector_id: "context_ready"
      event_name: "CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_READY"  # From manifest
      event_type: "CustomEvent"
    target:
      component_id: "momentum_scout_instance_1"
      connector_id: "context_ready"
      handler_method: "on_context_ready"  # From manifest
  
  # Custom event (manifest declared name)
  - wiring_id: "momentum_to_planner"
    source:
      component_id: "momentum_scout_instance_1"
      connector_id: "opportunity"
      event_name: "MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY"  # From manifest
      event_type: "CustomEvent"
    target:
      component_id: "strategy_planner_instance_1"
      connector_id: "signal_input"
      handler_method: "on_signal"
```

#### **Bootstrap (ConfigTranslator → EventWiringFactory)**
```python
# EventWiringFactory builds adapter configuration from wiring_map
adapters = factory.create_adapters(
    strategy_id="STRAT_001",
    workers={
        "ema_detector_instance_1": ema_worker,
        "momentum_scout_instance_1": momentum_worker,
        ...
    },
    wiring_spec=build_specs.wiring  # Contains all rules
)

# Each adapter configured with:
# - subscriptions: ["_ema_detector_instance_1_completion", "CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_READY"]
# - handler_mapping: {
#     "_ema_detector_instance_1_completion": "process",
#     "CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_READY": "on_context_ready"
#   }
# - system_event_publications: {"CONTINUE": "_momentum_scout_instance_1_completion"}
# - allowed_publications: {"MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY"}
```

#### **Runtime**
```python
# EventAdapter receives "_ema_detector_instance_1_completion" event
# Calls momentum_worker.process()
# Worker returns DispositionEnvelope(PUBLISH, "MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY", signal)
# EventAdapter validates "MOMENTUM_OPPORTUNITY" in allowed_publications
# EventAdapter publishes to EventBus
# strategy_planner's EventAdapter receives event
# Calls planner.on_signal(signal)
```

### **Architectural Principles**

1. **Workers are connector-based factories**
   - Input connectors = triggers
   - Output connectors = products
   - Zero knowledge of wiring/EventBus

2. **UI is the wiring authority**
   - System events: UI generates (deterministic) OR user renames
   - Custom events: UI uses manifest declarations
   - Wiring stored in `strategy_wiring_map.yaml` (static)

3. **Event names decided at configuration time**
   - NO runtime generation
   - ALL names in `strategy_wiring_map.yaml` before bootstrap
   - ConfigTranslator → BuildSpecs → EventWiringFactory → EventAdapters

4. **Connector types have different semantics**
   - System: Generated/renamable (flow control)
   - Custom: Declared/immutable (business logic)
   - Data: Explicit DTO flow (visualization only)

---

### **Event-Centric Wiring Model (Refined)**

**Critical Insight:** Wiring rules configure **individual EventAdapters**, NOT worker-to-worker connections.

**Incorrect Mental Model (Connection-Based):**
```yaml
# ❌ This suggests direct worker-to-worker connections
wiring_rules:
  - source: worker_a.output_connector
    target: worker_b.input_connector
```

**Correct Mental Model (Event-Centric, Adapter-Based):**
```yaml
# ✅ Each rule configures ONE adapter's subscriptions/publications
adapter_configurations:
  worker_a_adapter:
    publications:
      - connector_id: "completion"
        event_name: "WORKER_A_DONE"
        scope: "strategy"
  
  worker_b_adapter:
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: "WORKER_A_DONE"
        connector_id: "default_trigger"
        handler_method: "process"
```

**Key Distinction:**
- **Event names are the interface** (not worker references)
- **Adapters don't know sources or targets** (loose coupling)
- **EventBus routes events by name** (workers remain decoupled)

**Why This Matters:**
```python
# worker_b_adapter receives "WORKER_A_DONE" event
# Adapter does NOT know:
# - Which worker published it (worker_a? worker_x? platform singleton?)
# - Why it was published
# - Who else subscribed to it

# Adapter ONLY knows:
# - Event name matched subscription: "WORKER_A_DONE"
# - Which connector to trigger: "default_trigger"
# - Which handler to call: worker_b.process()
```

**Architecture Benefit:**
- Worker A can be replaced without touching worker B
- Multiple workers can publish same event name
- Multiple workers can subscribe to same event name
- Platform components and strategy workers use identical pattern

---

### **Uniform EventAdapter Pattern**

**Principle:** ALL components use the SAME EventAdapter, WITHOUT special cases.

**Components Using EventAdapter:**
- ✅ Strategy workers (SignalDetectors, ContextWorkers, etc.)
- ✅ Platform singletons (PositionManager, OrderRouter, etc.)
- ✅ FlowInitiators (per-strategy tick entry points)
- ✅ Any future component types

**NO Platform vs Strategy Distinction in EventAdapter:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Platform adapter with special logic
class PlatformEventAdapter(EventAdapter):
    def _publish_event(self, event_name: str, payload: Any):
        # Special platform logic here...
        self.bus.publish(event_name, ScopeLevel.PLATFORM, payload)

# ✅ CORRECT - Uniform adapter for ALL components
class EventAdapter:
    def __init__(self, component: IWorker, bus: EventBus, config: AdapterConfig):
        self._component = component
        self._bus = bus
        self._config = config  # Contains scope info
    
    def _publish_event(self, connector_id: str, payload: Any):
        # Scope determined by configuration, not adapter type
        publication = self._config.get_publication(connector_id)
        self._bus.publish(
            publication.event_name,
            publication.scope,  # PLATFORM or STRATEGY from config
            payload
        )
```

**How Platform/Strategy Separation Works:**
```yaml
# Platform singleton adapter config
adapter_configurations:
  position_manager_adapter:
    strategy_id: null  # ← Platform scope indicator
    publications:
      - connector_id: "position_updated"
        event_name: "POSITION_UPDATED"
        scope: "platform"  # ← EventBus will broadcast to ALL strategies

# Strategy worker adapter config
adapter_configurations:
  signal_detector_adapter:
    strategy_id: "STRAT_001"  # ← Strategy scope indicator
    publications:
      - connector_id: "signal_detected"
        event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
        scope: "strategy"  # ← EventBus will filter to STRAT_001 only
```

**EventBus Filtering (Automatic):**
```python
# EventBus implementation (simplified)
class EventBus:
    def publish(self, event_name: str, scope: ScopeLevel, payload: Any, strategy_id: str = None):
        if scope == ScopeLevel.PLATFORM:
            # Broadcast to all strategy scopes + platform subscribers
            self._publish_to_all_scopes(event_name, payload)
        elif scope == ScopeLevel.STRATEGY:
            # Publish only to specified strategy scope
            self._publish_to_strategy(event_name, payload, strategy_id)
    
    def subscribe(self, event_name: str, handler: Callable, strategy_id: str = None):
        # Subscribe to events in specific strategy scope
        # Platform components subscribe with strategy_id=None
        # Strategy components subscribe with their strategy_id
```

**Result:**
- EventAdapter code is IDENTICAL for platform and strategy components
- Scope filtering happens in EventBus (not adapter)
- Configuration determines behavior (not code)

---

### **Bootstrap Validation Strategy**

**Principle:** Fail-fast during bootstrap, trust configuration at runtime.

**Validation Timing:**
```
Configuration Load → Bootstrap Validation → Runtime (No Validation)
                           ↑
                    (Fail-fast here!)
```

**What Gets Validated at Bootstrap:**
1. **Connector existence** - Do declared connectors exist in manifest?
2. **Event name matching** - Do custom event connectors match across workers?
3. **Handler methods** - Do target workers have declared handler methods?
4. **Payload types** - Do source/target payload types match?
5. **Dependency completeness** - Are all required DTOs available?
6. **Scope validity** - Are scope declarations (PLATFORM/STRATEGY) valid?

**Bootstrap Validation Example:**
```python
# EventWiringFactory.create_adapters() - Runs ONCE at bootstrap
class EventWiringFactory:
    def create_adapters(
        self,
        strategy_id: str,
        workers: Dict[str, IWorker],
        wiring_spec: WiringSpec
    ) -> Dict[str, EventAdapter]:
        
        for rule in wiring_spec.adapter_configurations:
            # ✅ Validate connector exists in manifest
            if not self._connector_exists(rule.connector_id, worker.manifest):
                raise ConfigurationError(f"Connector {rule.connector_id} not in manifest")
            
            # ✅ Validate handler method exists
            if not hasattr(worker, rule.handler_method):
                raise ConfigurationError(f"Handler {rule.handler_method} not found")
            
            # ✅ Validate payload type compatibility
            if not self._payload_types_match(source_type, target_type):
                raise ConfigurationError(f"Payload type mismatch: {source_type} vs {target_type}")
        
        # If we reach here: Configuration is VALID
        return adapters
```

**What Does NOT Get Validated at Runtime:**
```python
# EventAdapter.handle_event() - Runs MANY times per second
class EventAdapter:
    def handle_event(self, event: Event):
        # ❌ NO validation here (performance critical!)
        # Trust that bootstrap validated everything
        
        subscription = self._config.get_subscription(event.name)
        handler = getattr(self._component, subscription.handler_method)
        result = handler(event.payload)
        
        # ❌ NO payload type checks
        # ❌ NO connector existence checks
        # ❌ NO event name validation
        # Trust bootstrap validation!
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Bootstrap: ~100ms one-time validation cost
- Runtime: ZERO validation overhead (thousands of events/second)
- Result: Fail-fast safety without performance penalty

---

### **Payload Type Declaration in Manifest**

**Problem Solved:** How does adapter know which payload type to expect/produce?

**Solution:** Declare payload types explicitly in manifest inputs/outputs.

**Enhanced Manifest Schema:**
```yaml
# plugins/signal_detectors/momentum_scout/manifest.yaml
plugin_id: "s1mple/momentum_scout/v1.0.0"

inputs:
  - connector_id: "default_trigger"
    type: "system"
    required: true
    payload_type: null  # System connectors typically no payload
  
  - connector_id: "context_ready"
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_READY"
    handler_method: "on_context_ready"
    payload_type: "ContextAssessment"  # ← Declares expected type
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.context_assessment.ContextAssessment"
    required: false

outputs:
  - connector_id: "completion"
    type: "system"
    payload_type: null
  
  - connector_id: "signal_detected"
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
    payload_type: "Signal"  # ← Declares produced type
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"
```

**Bootstrap Validation Uses This:**
```python
# EventWiringFactory validates type compatibility
class EventWiringFactory:
    def _validate_payload_compatibility(
        self,
        source_connector: ConnectorSpec,
        target_connector: ConnectorSpec
    ):
        if source_connector.payload_type != target_connector.payload_type:
            raise ConfigurationError(
                f"Payload type mismatch: "
                f"{source_connector.connector_id} produces {source_connector.payload_type}, "
                f"{target_connector.connector_id} expects {target_connector.payload_type}"
            )
        
        # Also validate source can be imported
        try:
            import_class(source_connector.payload_source)
        except ImportError as e:
            raise ConfigurationError(f"Cannot import {source_connector.payload_source}: {e}")
```

**Adapter Uses This at Runtime:**
```python
# EventAdapter knows what to expect (no runtime checks needed!)
class EventAdapter:
    def __init__(self, component: IWorker, config: AdapterConfig):
        self._subscriptions = {
            "CONTEXT_ASSESSMENT_READY": SubscriptionInfo(
                connector_id="context_ready",
                handler_method="on_context_ready",
                payload_type=ContextAssessment  # ← Known at bootstrap
            )
        }
    
    def handle_event(self, event: Event):
        sub = self._subscriptions[event.name]
        # No type check needed - bootstrap validated this!
        handler = getattr(self._component, sub.handler_method)
        handler(event.payload)  # Trust it's correct type
```

---

### **System DTOs vs TickCache DTOs (Clarified)**

**Two Separate Transport Mechanisms:**

#### **1. System DTOs (Transported via Events)**

**Purpose:** Flow control signals (Signal, Risk, StrategyDirective, etc.)

**Transport:** EventBus with DispositionEnvelope
```python
# SignalDetector publishes Signal via event
return DispositionEnvelope(
    disposition=Disposition.PUBLISH,
    event_name="MOMENTUM_SIGNAL",
    event_payload=Signal(confidence=0.85, ...)  # ← In event payload
)

# EventAdapter publishes to EventBus
self._bus.publish(
    "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL",
    scope=ScopeLevel.STRATEGY,
    payload=envelope.event_payload  # ← Signal travels in event
)

# StrategyPlanner receives via event
def on_signal(self, signal: Signal):
    # Signal came from event payload
    self.plan_entry(signal)
```

**Manifest Declaration:**
```yaml
outputs:
  - connector_id: "signal_detected"
    type: "custom_event"
    payload_type: "Signal"  # ← Declares event payload type
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"
```

#### **2. TickCache DTOs (Transported via StrategyCache)**

**Purpose:** Worker calculation results (EMAOutputDTO, MarketStructureDTO, etc.)

**Transport:** StrategyCache.set_result_dto() / get_required_dtos()
```python
# EMADetector stores result in TickCache
result = EMAOutputDTO(fast=50.2, slow=51.1, ...)
self.strategy_cache.set_result_dto(result)

return DispositionEnvelope(
    disposition=Disposition.CONTINUE
    # ← NO event_payload! Result is in TickCache
)

# Consumer retrieves from TickCache
class MomentumScout:
    def process(self):
        # Get DTO from cache
        ema_data = self.strategy_cache.get_required_dtos()[EMAOutputDTO]
        
        # Use in calculation
        if ema_data.fast > ema_data.slow:
            return self._publish_signal()
```

**Manifest Declaration:**
```yaml
# Producer manifest
dependencies:
  produces_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"

# Consumer manifest
dependencies:
  requires_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
```

**Key Difference:**
- **System DTOs:** Event-driven triggers (Signal → Plan → Execute)
- **TickCache DTOs:** Dependency resolution (EMA data available for MomentumScout)

---

### **Complete Architecture Flow Example**

**Scenario:** EMADetector → MomentumScout → StrategyPlanner

#### **1. Manifests**

```yaml
# plugins/context_workers/ema_detector/manifest.yaml
outputs:
  - connector_id: "completion"
    type: "system"
    payload_type: null
  - connector_id: "ema_data"
    type: "data"
    dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"

dependencies:
  produces_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
```

```yaml
# plugins/signal_detectors/momentum_scout/manifest.yaml
inputs:
  - connector_id: "default_trigger"
    type: "system"
    payload_type: null

outputs:
  - connector_id: "signal_detected"
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
    payload_type: "Signal"
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"

dependencies:
  requires_dtos:
    - source: "backend.dto_reg.s1mple.ema_detector.v1_0_0.ema_output_dto"
      dto_class: "EMAOutputDTO"
```

```yaml
# plugins/strategy_workers/strategy_planner/manifest.yaml
inputs:
  - connector_id: "signal_input"
    type: "custom_event"
    event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
    handler_method: "on_signal"
    payload_type: "Signal"
    payload_source: "backend.dtos.strategy.signal.Signal"
```

#### **2. Wiring Map (Event-Centric)**

```yaml
# strategy_wiring_map.yaml
adapter_configurations:
  ema_detector_adapter:
    strategy_id: "STRAT_001"
    publications:
      - connector_id: "completion"
        event_name: "_EMA_READY"
        scope: "strategy"
  
  momentum_scout_adapter:
    strategy_id: "STRAT_001"
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: "_EMA_READY"
        connector_id: "default_trigger"
        handler_method: "process"
    publications:
      - connector_id: "signal_detected"
        event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
        scope: "strategy"
  
  strategy_planner_adapter:
    strategy_id: "STRAT_001"
    subscriptions:
      - event_name: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL"
        connector_id: "signal_input"
        handler_method: "on_signal"
```

#### **3. Bootstrap Validation**

```python
# EventWiringFactory.create_adapters()
# ✅ Validates:
# - "completion" connector exists in ema_detector manifest
# - "default_trigger" connector exists in momentum_scout manifest
# - "process" method exists on MomentumScout worker
# - "signal_detected" connector exists in momentum_scout manifest
# - "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL" payload types match (Signal → Signal)
# - "on_signal" method exists on StrategyPlanner worker
# - EMAOutputDTO dependency available (requires_dtos satisfied)

# If ANY validation fails → ConfigurationError (fail-fast!)
# If ALL validations pass → Create adapters (trust at runtime)
```

#### **4. Runtime Execution**

```python
# Step 1: EMADetector processes
ema_detector.process()
# - Calculates EMA
# - Stores to TickCache: strategy_cache.set_result_dto(EMAOutputDTO(...))
# - Returns DispositionEnvelope(CONTINUE)
# - EventAdapter publishes "_EMA_READY" event (no payload)

# Step 2: EventBus routes "_EMA_READY" → momentum_scout_adapter
momentum_scout_adapter.handle_event(Event("_EMA_READY", None))
# - Looks up subscription: "_EMA_READY" → connector "default_trigger"
# - Calls momentum_scout.process()

# Step 3: MomentumScout processes
momentum_scout.process()
# - Retrieves EMAOutputDTO from TickCache
# - Detects momentum condition
# - Returns DispositionEnvelope(PUBLISH, "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL", Signal(...))
# - EventAdapter publishes "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL" event with Signal payload

# Step 4: EventBus routes "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL" → strategy_planner_adapter
strategy_planner_adapter.handle_event(Event("MOMENTUM_SIGNAL", Signal(...)))
# - Looks up subscription: "MOMENTUM_SIGNAL" → connector "signal_input"
# - Calls strategy_planner.on_signal(Signal(...))

# Step 5: StrategyPlanner processes
strategy_planner.on_signal(signal: Signal)
# - Receives Signal from event payload
# - Creates EntryPlan
# - Returns DispositionEnvelope(PUBLISH, "ENTRY_PLAN_READY", EntryPlan(...))
```

- ⚠️ EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md - Document event-centric wiring model (not connection-based)
- ⚠️ ConfigTranslator - Parse adapter_configurations from wiring_map
- ⚠️ EventWiringFactory - Implement bootstrap validation (fail-fast)
- ⚠️ EventAdapter - Remove any platform vs strategy distinctions (uniform implementation)
- ⚠️ AdapterConfig - Store scope (PLATFORM/STRATEGY) from wiring_map
- ⚠️ EventBus - Ensure scope filtering works correctly
- ⚠️ Strategy Builder UI - Generate event-centric wiring (not connection-based)
- ✅ Workers remain 100% event-agnostic (no changes needed)

### GAP-003: PUBLISH Disposition - Payload Location Ambiguity

**Location:** `EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md`, `WORKER_TAXONOMY.md`

**Problem:**
Documentation contradicts itself on where PUBLISH payload goes:

**EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md says (V2 pattern):**
```python
return DispositionEnvelope(
    disposition="PUBLISH",
    event_name="BREAKOUT_SIGNAL",
    event_payload=Signal(...)  # ❌ "Payload goes to TickCache, not event!"
)

# Note: This is a V2 pattern. V3 may include system DTOs in event payloads
```

**WORKER_TAXONOMY.md says:**
```python
# SignalDetector Output Pattern
DispositionEnvelope(PUBLISH) with Signal (system DTO)
```

**DispositionEnvelope DTO has:**
```python
class DispositionEnvelope(BaseModel):
    disposition: Literal["CONTINUE", "PUBLISH", "STOP"]
    event_payload: Optional[BaseModel] = None  # ← Field exists!
```

**Conflict:**
- If payload goes to TickCache (V2), why does DispositionEnvelope have `event_payload`?
- If payload goes in event (V3), why does doc say "V2 pattern"?
- **No clear V3 specification!**

**Scenario that fails:**
```python
# SignalDetector publishes
return DispositionEnvelope(
    disposition="PUBLISH",
    event_payload=Signal(confidence=0.85, ...)
)

# EventAdapter receives this - what does it do?
# Option A: Store to TickCache, publish notification-only event
cache.set_result_dto(worker, envelope.event_payload)
bus.publish("SIGNAL_DETECTED", payload=None)

# Option B: Publish payload directly in event
bus.publish("SIGNAL_DETECTED", payload=envelope.event_payload)

# Option C: Both (duplication!)
cache.set_result_dto(worker, envelope.event_payload)
bus.publish("SIGNAL_DETECTED", payload=envelope.event_payload)
```

**Consumer impact:**
```python
# If Option A: Consumer must read TickCache
def on_signal(event):
    signal = self.strategy_cache.get_result_dto(Signal)  # From cache
    process(signal)

# If Option B: Consumer reads event payload
def on_signal(event):
    signal = event['payload']  # From event directly
    process(signal)
```

**Design Question:**
Where should PUBLISH disposition payload go - TickCache, EventBus, or both?

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Option A: TickCache Only (V2 Pattern)**
```python
# Worker returns envelope
return DispositionEnvelope(
    disposition="PUBLISH",
    event_name="SIGNAL_DETECTED",
    event_payload=Signal(...)  # Stored to cache, NOT in event
)

# EventAdapter behavior
cache.set_result_dto(worker, envelope.event_payload)  # ✅ Store
bus.publish(envelope.event_name, payload=None)  # ✅ Notify only
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent with TickCache pattern (all DTOs in cache)
- ✅ Single source of truth (cache)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Consumers must access TickCache (coupling to cache)
- ⚠️ Async consumers can't get payload if TickCache cleared
- ⚠️ DispositionEnvelope.event_payload field is misleading

**Option B: EventBus Payload (V3 Simplified)**
```python
# Worker returns envelope
return DispositionEnvelope(
    disposition="PUBLISH",
    event_name="SIGNAL_DETECTED",
    event_payload=Signal(...)  # Goes directly in event
)

# EventAdapter behavior
bus.publish(envelope.event_name, payload=envelope.event_payload)  # ✅ Direct
# NOT stored to TickCache (signals are ephemeral)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple for consumers (payload in event)
- ✅ Async-friendly (subscribers get payload immediately)
- ✅ DispositionEnvelope.event_payload field makes sense

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Signals not in TickCache (inconsistent with context DTOs)
- ⚠️ Can't query TickCache for "what signals were published this tick?"

**Option C: Dual Write (Both)**
```python
# EventAdapter behavior
cache.set_result_dto(worker, envelope.event_payload)  # ✅ Persistence
bus.publish(envelope.event_name, payload=envelope.event_payload)  # ✅ Delivery
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best of both (cache persistence + event delivery)
- ✅ Flexible consumption (read from cache OR event)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Duplication (same data in two places)
- ⚠️ Sync overhead (two writes per publish)

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Option A: TickCache only (V2 pattern)
- [ ] Option B: EventBus payload (V3 simplified)
- [ ] Option C: Dual write (both cache and event)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Impact:**
- EventAdapter implementation
- Consumer (StrategyPlanner, PlanningAggregator) implementation
- DispositionEnvelope semantics
- WORKER_TAXONOMY.md, EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md rewrite

### GAP-004: EventAdapter Ownership & Creation Flow

**Location:** `EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md`, `LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Problem:**
Unclear **who creates and owns EventAdapter instances**:

**EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md says:**
```python
adapter_config = {
    'component_ref': worker_instance,  # ← Needs worker instance
    'eventbus_ref': eventbus,
    'subscriptions': [...]
}
```

**LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE.md says:**
```
EventWiringFactory - Wires EventAdapters to EventBus
```

**But:**
- WorkerFactory creates workers
- EventWiringFactory creates adapters
- **How does EventWiringFactory get worker references?**

**Problematic flow:**
```python
# Step 1: WorkerFactory creates workers
workers = WorkerFactory.build_all(workforce_spec)
# workers = [worker1, worker2, worker3]

# Step 2: EventWiringFactory creates adapters
# ❌ How does it get worker references from Step 1?
adapters = EventWiringFactory.create_adapters(wiring_spec)
# Needs worker references but WorkerFactory is done!
```

**Design Question:**
Who creates EventAdapters, who owns them, and what's the creation order?

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Option A: StrategyFactory Coordinates Both**
```python
class StrategyFactory:
    def build_strategy(self, strategy_spec: StrategyBuildSpec):
        # 1. Create workers
        workers = self.worker_factory.build_all(strategy_spec.workforce)
        
        # 2. Create adapters WITH worker references
        adapters = self.wiring_factory.create_adapters(
            wiring_spec=strategy_spec.wiring,
            worker_registry=workers  # ✅ Pass references
        )
        
        # 3. Wire adapters to EventBus
        for adapter in adapters:
            adapter.wire()
        
        return Strategy(workers=workers, adapters=adapters)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Clear coordination (one factory orchestrates)
- ✅ Worker references passed explicitly

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ StrategyFactory has more responsibility (orchestration)
- ⚠️ Need Strategy container object to return

**Option B: WorkerFactory Creates Adapters Too**
```python
class WorkerFactory:
    def build_worker(self, spec: WorkerBuildSpec) -> Tuple[Worker, EventAdapter]:
        # 1. Create worker
        worker = self._instantiate_worker(spec)
        
        # 2. Create adapter for this worker
        adapter = EventAdapter(
            component=worker,
            eventbus=self._eventbus
        )
        
        return worker, adapter
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ One factory, one responsibility (worker + adapter are paired)
- ✅ No coordination needed

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ WorkerFactory needs wiring knowledge (SRP violation?)
- ⚠️ Wiring configuration split between workforce and wiring specs

**Option C: Workers Self-Wrap with Adapters**
```python
class StandardWorker:
    def __init__(self, spec: WorkerBuildSpec):
        # Worker creates its own adapter
        self._adapter = EventAdapter(component=self, eventbus=spec.eventbus)
        self._adapter.wire(spec.subscriptions)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple (no factory coordination)
- ✅ Worker owns lifecycle

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Workers are NO LONGER bus-agnostic (architectural violation!)
- ⚠️ Workers must know EventBus (coupling)

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Option A: StrategyFactory coordinates (workers + adapters)
- [ ] Option B: WorkerFactory creates both
- [ ] Option C: Workers self-wrap (violates bus-agnostic principle)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Impact:**
- Factory hierarchy (WorkerFactory, EventWiringFactory, StrategyFactory)
- Worker initialization flow
- Bootstrap sequence
- LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE.md bootstrap section rewrite

## 🟡 MEDIUM GAPS (Inconsistencies to Resolve)

### GAP-005: ContextWorker Objective Data - No Enforcement

**Location:** `OBJECTIVE_DATA_PHILOSOPHY.md`, `WORKER_TAXONOMY.md`

**Problem:**
ContextWorkers must produce objective facts and NEVER publish to EventBus, but **nothing enforces this**:

**Philosophy says:**
```
ContextWorker Output Pattern:
- Stores plugin-specific DTOs to TickCache via set_result_dto()
- NEVER publishes events to EventBus
```

**Reality:**
```python
class MaliciousContextWorker(StandardWorker):
    def process(self) -> DispositionEnvelope:
        # ❌ I'm a ContextWorker but I break the rules
        return DispositionEnvelope(
            disposition="PUBLISH",  # Allowed!
            event_payload=Signal(...)
        )
        # No runtime error - platform doesn't check!
```

**Design Question:**
Should architectural constraints be enforced in code, or is documentation sufficient?

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Option A: Type-Safe Base Classes**
```python
class BaseContextWorker(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self) -> Literal["CONTINUE"]:
        """Context workers can ONLY return CONTINUE."""
        ...

class EMADetector(BaseContextWorker):
    def process(self) -> Literal["CONTINUE"]:
        self.strategy_cache.set_result_dto(self, dto)
        return "CONTINUE"  # ✅ Type system enforces
    
    # def process(self) -> DispositionEnvelope:
    #     return DispositionEnvelope(disposition="PUBLISH")
    # ❌ Type error - return type mismatch!
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Compile-time enforcement (Pylance catches violations)
- ✅ Clear contract (type signature enforces behavior)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ More base class complexity
- ⚠️ DispositionEnvelope not used by ContextWorkers (different pattern)

**Option B: EventAdapter Validation**
```python
class EventAdapter:
    def _interpret_disposition(self, envelope: DispositionEnvelope):
        # Check manifest type
        if self.worker_manifest.type == "context_worker":
            if envelope.disposition == "PUBLISH":
                raise ArchitecturalViolation(
                    "ContextWorkers cannot PUBLISH to EventBus"
                )
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Runtime enforcement (catches violations)
- ✅ DispositionEnvelope pattern preserved

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Runtime error (not caught at compile time)
- ⚠️ Fails late (during execution, not bootstrap)

**Option C: Bootstrap Validation**
```python
class DependencyValidator:
    def validate_workforce(self, workforce_spec: WorkforceSpec):
        for worker_spec in workforce_spec.workers:
            if worker_spec.manifest.type == "context_worker":
                # Check wiring spec
                if self._worker_publishes_events(worker_spec):
                    raise ConfigurationError(
                        f"ContextWorker {worker_spec.name} "
                        "configured to publish events (architectural violation)"
                    )
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Fail-fast (bootstrap catches violations)
- ✅ Prevents deployment of broken configurations

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires wiring spec inspection (complex validation)
- ⚠️ Can't catch violations in worker code (only config)

**Option D: Documentation Only (Current)**
```
Trust developers to follow documented conventions.
No code enforcement.
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Simple (no enforcement code)
- ✅ Flexible (power users can break rules if needed)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Easy to violate accidentally
- ⚠️ No safety net

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Option A: Type-safe base classes (compile-time)
- [ ] Option B: EventAdapter validation (runtime)
- [ ] Option C: Bootstrap validation (fail-fast)
- [ ] Option D: Documentation only (no enforcement)
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Impact:**
- BaseWorker class hierarchy
- EventAdapter implementation
- DependencyValidator scope
- Developer experience (friction vs safety)

### GAP-006: PlanningAggregator Architectural Position

**Location:** `WORKER_TAXONOMY.md`, `PLATFORM_COMPONENTS.md`

**Problem:**
PlanningAggregator is mentioned as "platform component (NOT worker)" but:
- NOT listed in PLATFORM_COMPONENTS.md
- NOT listed in LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE.md singletons
- No specification of lifecycle, ownership, or creation

**Questions:**
1. Is PlanningAggregator a **singleton** or **per-strategy instance**?
2. Who creates it? (StrategyFactory? Platform bootstrap?)
3. Where does it live? (`backend/core/`? `backend/aggregators/`?)
4. Does it have an EventAdapter? (If it subscribes to events, it needs one)
5. Is it a worker in disguise? (It processes events, produces output)

**Design Question:**
What IS PlanningAggregator architecturally?

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Option A: Platform Singleton Component**
```python
# backend/core/planning_aggregator.py
class PlanningAggregator:
    """Singleton platform component (like EventBus, StrategyCache)."""
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
    
    def aggregate_plans(
        self,
        entry: EntryPlan,
        size: SizePlan,
        exit: ExitPlan,
        execution: ExecutionPlan
    ) -> ExecutionDirective:
        """Combine 4 plans into ExecutionDirective."""
        ...
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent with other platform components
- ✅ Shared across all strategies

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Multi-strategy concurrency (same singleton issue as StrategyCache)
- ⚠️ How to isolate plans per strategy?

**Option B: Per-Strategy Component (Not Singleton)**
```python
# Created by StrategyFactory
class PlanningAggregator:
    def __init__(self, strategy_id: str):
        self._strategy_id = strategy_id
        self._pending_plans = {}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Natural strategy isolation
- ✅ Clear ownership (strategy owns its aggregator)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Not a "platform component" (per-strategy instance)
- ⚠️ Must be managed by StrategyFactory

**Option C: It's Actually a Worker**
```python
# Rename to PlanningAggregatorWorker
class PlanningAggregatorWorker(StandardWorker):
    """
    Special worker type: planning_aggregator
    Subscribes to plan events, publishes ExecutionDirective
    """
    manifest.type = "planning_aggregator"
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Consistent with worker pattern (subscribes, processes, publishes)
- ✅ WorkerFactory handles creation
- ✅ EventAdapter handles wiring

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Philosophy says "platform component, NOT worker"
- ⚠️ Mandatory for all strategies (not optional plugin)

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Option A: Platform singleton
- [ ] Option B: Per-strategy component
- [ ] Option C: Special worker type
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Impact:**
- PLATFORM_COMPONENTS.md update
- Factory responsibilities
- Worker taxonomy (if Option C)
- Wiring configuration

---

### GAP-007: ExecutionDirective Causality ID Duplication

**Location:** `backend/dtos/execution/execution_directive.py`, `backend/dtos/causality.py`

**Problem:**
ExecutionDirective has ID in **two places**:

```python
class ExecutionDirective(BaseModel):
    execution_directive_id: str = Field(default_factory=generate_execution_directive_id)
    causality: CausalityChain  # Also contains execution_directive_id!

class CausalityChain(BaseModel):
    execution_directive_id: str | None = None
```

**Scenario:**
```python
directive = ExecutionDirective(
    execution_directive_id="EXD_123",  # Field 1
    causality=CausalityChain(
        execution_directive_id="EXD_456"  # Field 2 - DIFFERENT!
    )
)
# Which ID is canonical?
```

**Design Question:**
Should IDs live in parent DTO or in causality chain?

**Proposed Solutions:**

**Option A: ID in Causality Only**
```python
class ExecutionDirective(BaseModel):
    # No execution_directive_id field
    causality: CausalityChain  # Contains ID

# Access via causality
directive.causality.execution_directive_id
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Single source of truth (causality chain)
- ✅ Consistent (all IDs in causality)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Verbose access (need to go through causality)
- ⚠️ Causality chain semantics unclear (is it metadata or just ID container?)

**Option B: ID in Parent Only**
```python
class ExecutionDirective(BaseModel):
    execution_directive_id: str = Field(default_factory=...)
    causality: CausalityChain  # NO execution_directive_id

class CausalityChain(BaseModel):
    # execution_directive_id field removed
    tick_id: str
    signal_ids: list[str]
    # Only upstream IDs, not own ID
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Intuitive access (directive.execution_directive_id)
- ✅ Causality chain is pure lineage (no self-reference)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Inconsistent with other DTOs (Signal has ID in both places?)
- ⚠️ Must build causality chain with directive ID separately

**Option C: Validation to Enforce Consistency**
```python
class ExecutionDirective(BaseModel):
    execution_directive_id: str
    causality: CausalityChain
    
    @model_validator(mode='after')
    def validate_causality_consistency(self) -> 'ExecutionDirective':
        if self.causality.execution_directive_id != self.execution_directive_id:
            raise ValueError("Causality chain ID must match directive ID")
        return self
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Prevents inconsistency
- ✅ Both fields exist (backward compatible)

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Duplication still exists (just validated)
- ⚠️ Must set ID in two places (boilerplate)

**Decision Needed:**
- [ ] Option A: Causality only (remove from parent)
- [ ] Option B: Parent only (remove from causality)
- [ ] Option C: Both with validation
- [ ] Other: _______________

**Impact:**
- ExecutionDirective, Signal, Risk DTO structure
- CausalityChain semantics
- DTO creation boilerplate

---

### GAP-008: Multi-Strategy Concurrent Execution Design Missing

**Location:** `LAYERED_ARCHITECTURE.md` (ParallelRunService mentioned)

**Problem:**
ParallelRunService is listed as Service Layer component for "parallel strategy execution", but:
- StrategyCache is singleton (GAP-001)
- EventBus is N-to-N broadcast (no strategy namespacing)
- TickCacheManager design missing
- No isolation mechanism specified

**Design Question:**
How do multiple strategies run concurrently without interfering?

**Required Decisions:**
1. **Strategy Isolation:** Separate cache instances or multi-tenant singleton?
2. **Event Namespacing:** Strategy-scoped topics or event filtering?
3. **RunAnchor Management:** Different timestamps per strategy - how to manage?
4. **Resource Sharing:** Which singletons are truly shared vs per-strategy?

**Proposed Approach:**
```python
class ParallelRunService:
    def run_strategies(self, strategy_ids: list[str]):
        # Create isolated context per strategy
        for strategy_id in strategy_ids:
            context = StrategyExecutionContext(
                strategy_id=strategy_id,
                cache=self._get_or_create_cache(strategy_id),
                event_scope=f"strategy.{strategy_id}.*"
            )
            
            # Run in separate thread/async task
            self._executor.submit(self._run_strategy, context)
```

**Decision Needed:**
Design complete multi-strategy execution architecture (separate doc?)

**Impact:**
- All singleton components (StrategyCache, EventBus, TickCacheManager)
- ParallelRunService implementation
- Strategy isolation guarantees

---

## 🟢 MINOR GAPS (Edge Cases & Polish)

### GAP-009: STOP Disposition Cleanup Protocol Undefined

**Location:** `EVENT_DRIVEN_WIRING.md`

**Problem:**
STOP disposition triggers cleanup, but cleanup protocol is undefined:

```python
return DispositionEnvelope(disposition="STOP")
# EventAdapter publishes flow-stop event
# Then what?
```

**Questions:**
- Who is "FlowTerminator" (mentioned but not documented)?
- What cleanup happens? (Clear TickCache? Close connections? Persist state?)
- Can STOP be called mid-chain? (What happens to downstream workers?)
- Is cleanup synchronous or asynchronous?

**Decision Needed:**
Define explicit STOP cleanup protocol and FlowTerminator component.

**Impact:**
- EventAdapter implementation
- TickCacheManager lifecycle
- Platform shutdown sequence

---

### GAP-010: Worker Schema Double Validation Overhead

**Location:** `CONFIG_BUILDSPEC_TRANSLATION_DESIGN.md`

**Problem:**
Worker params validated twice without caching benefit:

```python
# ConfigTranslator validates
validated_params = schema_class.model_validate(entry.params)
spec.config_params = validated_params.model_dump()  # ← Convert to dict

# Worker validates again
self._params = schema_class.model_validate(spec.config_params)  # ← From dict
```

**Issue:**
Pydantic caching only works with identical objects. Dict → Model → Dict → Model loses cache.

**Performance Impact:**
50 workers = 100 validations (50% overhead)

**Design Question:**
Accept overhead as defense-in-depth, or optimize?

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Option A: BuildSpec stores Pydantic model (not dict)
- Option B: Worker trusts BuildSpec (no re-validation)
- Option C: Accept overhead (security > performance)

**Decision Needed:**
Choose validation strategy (security vs performance trade-off)

**Impact:**
- BuildSpec schema
- Worker constructor pattern
- Bootstrap performance

---

### GAP-011: RunAnchor Timezone Handling Undefined

**Location:** `POINT_IN_TIME_MODEL.md`

**Problem:**
RunAnchor timestamp has no timezone enforcement:

```python
class RunAnchor(BaseModel):
    timestamp: datetime  # Naive or aware? Which timezone?
```

**Scenario:**
```python
# TickCacheManager creates anchor
anchor = RunAnchor(timestamp=datetime.now(timezone.utc))  # UTC

# Worker requests data
df = self.ohlcv_provider.get_window(end_time=anchor.timestamp)

# Provider returns data in exchange timezone (EST)
# ❌ Timestamp mismatch - possible data leakage!
```

**Design Question:**
Should RunAnchor enforce timezone?

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Option A: Enforce UTC-aware (validation in RunAnchor)
- Option B: Provider converts to anchor timezone (responsibility on provider)
- Option C: Document convention (no enforcement)

**Decision Needed:**
Choose timezone handling strategy.

**Impact:**
- RunAnchor validation
- Provider interface contracts
- Data integrity guarantees

---

### GAP-012: BuildSpec Worker Class Circular Dependency

**Location:** `CONFIG_BUILDSPEC_TRANSLATION_DESIGN.md`

**Problem:**
BuildSpec needs worker class reference, but class is loaded by factory:

```python
class WorkerBuildSpec(BaseModel):
    worker_class: type  # ← How to get this?

# ConfigTranslator creates BuildSpec
spec = WorkerBuildSpec(
    worker_class=???  # Who loads the class?
)

# WorkerFactory loads class
worker = spec.worker_class(spec)
```

**Chicken-and-egg:**
ConfigTranslator needs class → Factory loads class → Factory needs BuildSpec

**Design Question:**
Who is responsible for loading worker classes?

**Proposed Solutions:**
- Option A: BuildSpec stores module path (string), Factory loads class
- Option B: PluginRegistry pre-loads all classes, ConfigTranslator references
- Option C: BuildSpec stores class reference, ConfigTranslator imports dynamically

**Decision Needed:**
Choose plugin loading strategy.

**Impact:**
- BuildSpec schema
- ConfigTranslator responsibilities
- PluginRegistry role
