# Scope-aware rerun optimization context fingerprint model (Relocated)

**Status:** RELOCATED  
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-28

## Relocation

This document has been moved to:

- [docs/development/issue255/research_scope_aware_rerun_optimization.md](../issue255/research_scope_aware_rerun_optimization.md)

Reason:

- The content defines a shared refactor/optimization architecture spanning both `run_quality_gates` and `run_tests`.
- That scope belongs to umbrella issue #255.

---

## Issue #251 Scope Boundary (Active)

Issue #251 remains intentionally narrow and execution-focused:

- minimal-effort stabilization,
- reliable daily usage across all current scopes (`auto`, `branch`, `project`, `files`),
- research/planning/TDD/validation for pragmatic fixes only,
- no broad cross-tool optimization refactor.
