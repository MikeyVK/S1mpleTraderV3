# GitHub Copilot Instructions

**🛑 CRITICAL: Read [agent.md](../agent.md) in workspace root FIRST before any work.**

## Why This Matters

`agent.md` contains the **complete operational protocol** for this project:

1. **Tool usage policy** - NEVER use `run_in_terminal` for files/git/tests
2. **TDD cycle requirements** - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR with commits
3. **Phase transition protocols** - Sequential workflow enforcement
4. **Complete tool priority matrix** - Which MCP tool to use for every operation
5. **Issue-first development** - All work starts with GitHub issues
6. **Quality gates** - Validation before phase transitions

## What Happens If You Ignore This

❌ **Violations of agent.md protocol will be rejected by the user**

- File operations without MCP tools → bypass template validation
- Git operations without workflow tools → break audit trail
- Tests without run_tests tool → miss quality gates
- Skipping TDD cycles → violate project standards

## Quick Reference

Before ANY action, check:
- Section 2.3 (TDD Cycle) - for test writing
- Section 5 (Tool Priority Matrix) - for tool selection
- run_in_terminal Restrictions - for terminal usage limits

## Agent Cooperation

This project uses **agent handoff** for large tasks:
- Each agent reads agent.md at session start
- Fresh context every 50-100K tokens to avoid context pollution
- All agents follow same protocol (consistency)

**Remember: agent.md is your contract with this codebase. Follow it strictly.**
