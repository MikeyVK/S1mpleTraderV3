Worker Interface - Base protocol for all worker types.

    Protocol for worker lifecycle management (two-phase initialization).

    Workers follow two-phase initialization pattern:
    1. Construction (__init__): Receive BuildSpec, store manifest data
    2. Runtime initialization (initialize): Inject runtime dependencies

    This decouples worker configuration (BuildSpec) from runtime platform
    services (StrategyCache, capabilities). Workers remain testable in
    isolation without platform singletons.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Construction phase
        worker = OpportunityWorker(build_spec)

        # Runtime initialization
        worker.initialize(
            strategy_cache=platform.strategy_cache,
            persistence=persistence_service,
            strategy_ledger=ledger_service
        )

        # Active phase
        # ... worker operates normally ...

        # Cleanup phase
        worker.shutdown()
        ```

    Capabilities:
        - persistence: IPersistenceService (optional)
        - strategy_ledger: IStrategyLedger (optional)
        - aggregated_ledger: IAggregatedLedger (optional)

    See: docs/development/IWORKERLIFECYCLE_DESIGN.md

        - Background tasks are cancelled
        - Cached state is flushed if needed

        Phase Transition: Active → Shutdown

        Critical Requirements:
            - MUST NOT raise exceptions (catch and log internally)
            - MUST be idempotent (safe to call multiple times)
            - SHOULD complete within reasonable time (<5s typical)

        Note:
            This is NOT a destructor (__del__). It's explicit lifecycle
            management. Platform orchestrator calls this during graceful
            shutdown sequences.

class WorkerInitializationError(Exception):

    Exception raised when worker initialization fails.

    This exception signals that a worker could not complete its

    - Required capability missing
