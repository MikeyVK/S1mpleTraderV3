class AggregatedContextAssessment(BaseModel):
    """
    Aggregated SWOT assessment combining multiple context factors.

    The ContextAggregator collects ContextFactors from various ContextWorkers
    and groups them into strengths and weaknesses. This assessment forms the
    foundation for opportunity and threat detection.

    **SWOT Quadrants:** Strengths + Weaknesses â†’ Opportunities + Threats

    **Key Constraints:**
    - At least one of strengths or weaknesses must be non-empty
    - All factors in strengths list must have strength scores
    - All factors in weaknesses list must have weakness scores
    - Assessment ID follows ASS_ prefix convention
    - Timestamp must be timezone-aware (UTC)

    **Usage Example:**
    ```python
    strength1 = ContextFactor(
        factor_type=BaseFactorType.TRENDING_REGIME.value,
        strength=0.75,
        weakness=None,
        source_plugin="trend_analyzer",
        source_context_type=ContextType.REGIME_CLASSIFICATION.value
    )

    weakness1 = ContextFactor(
        factor_type=BaseFactorType.HIGH_VOLATILITY.value,
        strength=None,
        weakness=0.60,
        source_plugin="volatility_detector",
        source_context_type=ContextType.VOLATILITY_ASSESSMENT.value
    )

    assessment = AggregatedContextAssessment(
        timestamp=datetime.now(timezone.utc),
        strengths=[strength1],
        weaknesses=[weakness1],
        metadata={"total_workers": 5, "aggregation_method": "weighted_avg"}
    )
    ```

    **Philosophy:**
    This DTO is a "dumb" container - it validates structure but doesn't
    interpret meaning. The OpportunityDetector and ThreatDetector workers
    are "smart" - they analyze the factors to identify actionable signals.

        assessment_id: Unique identifier with ASS_ prefix
        timestamp: When this assessment was created (UTC timezone-aware)
        strengths: List of strength factors (can be empty)
